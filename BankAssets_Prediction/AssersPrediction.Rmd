## Bank Asset Prediction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r bankdetails}
bankdata <- read.csv("Output.csv")
summary(bankdata)
hist(bankdata$Total.Assets,breaks = 30)
boxplot(bankdata$Total.Assets)

require(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=bankdata,aes(x=Institution.Name..RSSD.ID.,y=Total.Assets)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(Date~.)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:_

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
bankJp <- subset(bankdata[bankdata$Institution.Name..RSSD.ID. == "JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (1039502)",])

bankJp$Date <- as.Date(bankJp$Date,"%m/%d/%Y")
str(bankJp)

model = lm(Total.Assets ~ months(Date),data = bankJp)

test <- data.frame(Date = as.Date(c("9/30/2016","12/30/2016"), "%m/%d/%Y"),Total.Assets=c(0,0))
plot(bankJp$Date,bankJp$Total.Assets,col="blue",main="Asset Trend for J.P.Morgan",
abline(model),cex = 1.3,pch = 16,xlab = "Year",ylab = "TotalAssets")

result <- predict(model,test)
print(result)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
